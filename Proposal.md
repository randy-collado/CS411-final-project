Proposal 1: A digital multimedia diary where users can attach music to certain locations that are associated with memories. They will be able to login, add memories, sort memories by both location and the music, and other features that are to be developed throughout the lifetime of the project.

APIs to be used: Spotify API, Google Maps API

Proposal 2: A transit app where you register times you want to be notified of certain transit options, and pings you within a user-defined time window of arriving transit options. For example. if you have a class at 3pm, and you want to be notified of train times 30 mintues before 3pm, the service will periodically text you arrival times for the trains you have selected.

APIs to be used: Twilio API, Here Public Transit API

Frameworks: React (Frontend) and Flask (Backend) ***Backend might change, this is for development, planning for a plug-and-play architecture***

Other Technologies:
1. Database: mongoDB (through pymongo)
2. Styling: Tailwind???

Mid-semester deliverable: A working application with login capabilities, user persistence, and partial integration with the APIs
