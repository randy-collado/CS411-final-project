Proposal: Our team has decided to develop a digital multimedia library where users can attach music to certain locations that are associated with memories. They will be able to login, add memories, sort memories by both location and the music, and other features that are to be developed throughout the lifetime of the project.

APIs to be used: Spotify API, Google Maps API
Frameworks: React (Frontend) and Flask (Backend) ***Backend might change, this is for development, planning for a plug-and-play architecture***
Other Technologies:
1. Database: mongoDB (through pymongo)
2. Styling: Tailwind???
Mid-semester deliverable: A working front-page with login capabilities, user persistence, and partial integration with the APIs
